pig_romance
===========

First there was PigLatin, then there was PigRomance, a linguistic derivative.

The goal of this project is to experiment with what is involved in making a more principled Pig. Pig is a useful tool, but it has been around for a long time and the codebase is hamstrung by backwards compatibility issues, and refactoring core pieces is impossible. This is an attempt to see what Pig would look like if the syntax is preserved (with some unifying choices), and it is rebuilt emphasizing immutability and understandability (and hopefully speed!).
